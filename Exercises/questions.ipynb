    "### L03-Introduction to Python language\n",
    "##### Q1:\n",
    "Create a Virtual Environment of Python 2 or 3 and install the following packages: `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` within the created Virtual Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q2:\n",
    "Use list comprehension to create a Python list containing $[0^2 + 1, 1^2 + 1, 2^2 + 1, ......, 30^2 + 1]$ and calculate the sum of all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: the sum is 9486.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q3:\n",
    "The value of $\\pi$ can be computed by: $$\\pi = \\sqrt{12} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-\\frac{1}{3})^k}{2k+1} $$\n",
    "Write a Python function `cal_pi` to calculate the value of $\\pi$ using the formula above, and apply the function to compute an approximation of $\\pi$ with $k=200$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: `k` should be an input parameter of the function and use a for loop to compute the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q4:\n",
    "Write a Python function `diff2` to compute the second-order derivative of function $f(x)$: $$f''(x) \\approx \\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)-2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}$$\n",
    "Apply `diff2` to differentiate $f(x) = x^{4}$ at $x = 1$. The result can be computed easily by hand and it is 12. So you can use this number to verify your Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: see the example of function `diff1` in the lecture notes. Be careful with the value of $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q5:\n",
    "Write a Python class *Line* to represent a straight line in the Cartesian plane. The class consists of a constructor that takes two points (two lists or tuples, e.g. [x1, y1] and [x2, y2]) as the input, and a method that computes the `y` value by giving a `x`. Apply the class to points (0, 0) and (10, 10) and calculate the `y` value at $x = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q6:\n",
    "Reimplement the second-order derivative function `diff2` mentioned in question 4 by using Python class. Apply the class to differentiate $f(x) = x^{4}$ at $x = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: see the example class `Derivative` in the lecture notes.\t\n",

    "Consider a 3D array with dimension (3, 4, 5). Multiply it by a 2D array with dimension (3, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q15:\n",
    "Consider a vector of size 3 contains the coordinates of a point P in the Cartesian plane, and a 2D array of dimension (10, 3) comprises the coordinates of other 10 points. Calculate the distance between point P and each point in the 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: $distance = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2 + (z_1 - z_0)^2}$\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Q17:\n",
    "Consider a set of discreate points: $x = np.linspace(0, 2\\pi, 10), y = \\sin(x^{2/3})$. Interpolate them onto a new set of x points: $x = np.linspace(0, 2\\pi, 50)$ using linear and cubic methods. Plot the raw and interpolated data in one figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Q18:\n",
    "Integrate function $f(x) = e^{x^2}$ over `0` to `1` using two different methods.\n",
